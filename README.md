# Official repository on TDMINING.

TDMINING is a process to generate data and knowledge about code smells, with a focus on the developer.

TDMINING is a process addressed in master's dissertation research, as presented on 10/13/2021. https://www.ppgia.pucpr.br/pt/?q=node/295.

TDMINING is independent of static code analysis tool or statistical analysis tools.

Tools such as SonarQube, python script with numPy libraries, Pandas and other machine learning and data science packages, etc. were used for the TDMINING experiments.

For data visualization used in Jupyter Notebook, but it can be adapted to Grafana or any other tool.

This repo includes the artifacts used to run the TDMINING experiment:

FOLDER:

BPMN> Directory with the design of the TDMINING process. Use Bizagi Modeler software to visualize.

DATA_SQLSERVER> Data backup file, in Microsoft SQL Server format. Contains data backups referring to the STARSCHEMA of Experiment 1.

DOCS> Forms used in the experiment.

PYTHON> Script used to process the data of the operation for the execution of the experiment, as well as the files to visualize the results (ipynb from the Notebook Jupyter).

SQL> Script for creating, extracting, transforming and loading data.
